## No mining in PoA

`miner` is still valid. By definition, `mining` is the process by which transactions are verified and added to the public ledger. the only difference is

```
for `PoW`: The mining process involves compiling recent transactions into blocks and trying to solve a computationally difficult puzzle
for `PoA`: The mining process involves choosing a signer among a list of authorised signers to produce the block
```

when they say there is no mining in PoA, they mean you donâ€™t need to solve any CPU-intensive cryptography puzzle
